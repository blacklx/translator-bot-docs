# Privacy Policy for Translator Bot

## 1. Data collected
The bot processes message content, metadata (channel IDs, message IDs), and attachments as part of normal Discord functionality.

## 2. How data is used
Data is only used to mirror and translate messages into other language channels on the same Discord server.

## 3. Storage
The bot does not permanently store messages. Processing occurs in memory and in a temporary queue system (Redis). Some technical logs and statistics (e.g. number of translations and errors) are stored locally by the bot owner.

## 4. Third parties
Message content is sent to the Google Translate API for translation. No data is shared with any other third parties.

## 5. Your rights
If you do not want your messages to be translated, do not use channels connected to the bot.

## 6. Contact
For questions, contact the server administrator or the bot owner.
